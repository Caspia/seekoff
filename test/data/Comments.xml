However, given that this beta has been live for less than half an hour, I don't think we've seen enough questions to get a feel for what works, what doesn't, and what should be clarified. In other words, I don't think there's enough information yet to answer this question well." CreationDate="2013-05-22T21:09:52.650" UserId="21" />

  <row Id="34" PostId="6" Score="0" Text="@greatwolf see my last response, python is used in the development of Blender, it can be used for several purposes such as adding GUI elements and as such could be valid. Another reason is C/C++ would stray too far from actual Blender and more into low level stuff and os related complexities. Python is used extensively in Blender and is a main part of it. So as I initially said, depending on how it is worded, it *could* be valid but would not be plausible or at least get a definitive response if used as it is in the example above."
